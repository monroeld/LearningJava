<h1 id="learningjava">LearningJava</h1>
<p>Luke needs to learn a thing or two about Java. The main benefit is the ImageJ programming flexibility, though these will need to be plugins rather than macros, which is a whole 'nother can of worms. A side benefit is that it'll serve as a pseudo-refresher in Python, 'cause Java's a bit like Python's overbearing father (avoiding the obvious class-ist joke)</p>
<p>There'll be subfolders from different courses. They'll probably only get modified one at a time, so everything's going to get committed to the master. Also, Luke's going to be the only one using this. Just sayin'</p>
